Coding Questions:

    Optimizing Matrix Multiplications:
        Question: Given that matrix multiplications are critical in ML workloads, write code to optimize a matrix multiplication algorithm for a high-performance ML accelerator.
        Focus: This could involve using cache-aware algorithms, loop unrolling, or SIMD instructions to improve performance. They might be interested in hearing how you would optimize data movement or reduce memory bandwidth issues in a hardware-constrained environment.

    Lowering High-Level ML Operations to Low-Level IR (Intermediate Representation):
        Question: Write code to lower a high-level ML operation (e.g., a convolution or matrix multiplication) into an intermediate representation like MLIR.
        Focus: They might want to see how well you understand the process of translating high-level ML workloads into representations that can be efficiently executed on custom hardware. This could also involve discussing how you'd handle things like quantization or custom hardware features.

    Memory Management in ML Kernels:
        Question: Design a memory allocation strategy for a matrix multiplication kernel running on an AI accelerator. How would you optimize the usage of on-chip memory (e.g., SRAM or cache) and minimize memory access latencies?
        Focus: Efficient memory use, particularly on custom hardware with constrained memory hierarchies, is key for performance. They may be looking for your understanding of cache locality, prefetching, and minimizing DRAM accesses.

    Quantization-Aware Code:
        Question: Write a function that performs quantized matrix multiplication. Include strategies for minimizing quantization error and maintaining performance.
        Focus: They may want to see how well you can handle fixed-point arithmetic, low-precision computations, and quantization techniques while optimizing for both accuracy and speed on hardware.

    Compiler Optimization Pass:
        Question: Implement a simple optimization pass in a compiler for a basic operation like dead code elimination or loop unrolling.
        Focus: They’ll be looking for how well you understand compiler internals and how optimization passes can enhance the performance of machine learning workloads. Given their experience in MLIR, they might want you to think in terms of IR transformations.

Design Questions:

    Design a Compiler for Custom AI Silicon:
        Question: Design a compiler for a new AI accelerator. What are the key considerations you’d take into account to map ML models onto this hardware?
        Focus: Discuss challenges such as instruction set architecture (ISA), data movement optimizations, kernel fusion, and graph-level optimizations (e.g., operator fusion, loop fusion). They will likely be interested in how you would co-design the compiler to exploit specific hardware features of the custom silicon.

    MLIR for Machine Learning Models:
        Question: How would you design an MLIR-based framework to optimize end-to-end ML models from high-level graph representations to hardware-specific code generation?
        Focus: They’ll want to hear about how you would take a model from something like PyTorch or TensorFlow and lower it through multiple representations, applying graph optimizations, handling custom hardware accelerators, and generating efficient low-level code.

    High-Performance Execution for ML Models:
        Question: How would you design a runtime system to ensure high-performance execution of ML models on custom hardware, ensuring minimal data movement and efficient use of compute resources?
        Focus: Discuss how you’d optimize the runtime for handling large model graphs, scheduling computations efficiently, and minimizing latency and data transfer. They might also want to hear how you would leverage hardware-software co-design to maximize throughput.

    End-to-End ML Pipeline for Custom Hardware:
        Question: Design an end-to-end pipeline to take a high-level ML model (e.g., in PyTorch) and deploy it on a custom AI chip. What would the stages of compilation, optimization, and deployment look like?
        Focus: This is about understanding the overall flow from a high-level ML model down to hardware-specific optimizations. Discuss the compilation stages (e.g., from ONNX or PyTorch to low-level IRs like MLIR or LLVM) and how you’d optimize across the stack for quantization, low-precision arithmetic, and hardware accelerators.

    Handling Dynamic Workloads in ML Compilers:
        Question: How would you handle dynamic or control flow-heavy workloads in an ML compiler targeting custom silicon?
        Focus: ML workloads often include dynamic behaviors (like conditionals, loops with data-dependent bounds, etc.). They might want to hear how you would optimize these workloads for an accelerator that excels at static, parallel operations. Discuss branch prediction, loop unrolling, and dynamic graph execution.

Possible Conceptual Topics:

    Hardware-aware Quantization: Given their background in quantization, they may want to explore how to make hardware-aware quantization decisions and how compilers can play a role in optimizing this at compile-time.

    Co-Designing AI Accelerators and Compilers: Since they have worked on AI hardware-software codesign, they might ask how you would ensure that the compiler and runtime fully exploit the hardware features (like specific matrix multiplication engines or custom instructions).

    Optimization of Dataflow for Accelerators: They could ask how you would optimize dataflow in ML models to minimize off-chip memory accesses, reduce latency, and maximize utilization of compute cores in custom hardware.

Summary:

Your interviewer is likely to be interested in questions that require understanding how machine learning workloads can be efficiently compiled and executed on custom hardware, especially in terms of memory management, data movement, and compiler optimizations. They may also explore how you would apply these concepts in real-world systems like the ones they worked on at Waymo and Google.
